# Supabase x Express.js x Handlebars x Node

## Description

This repository was a test of mine to explore using Supabase with Express and Handlebars.

This application can connect to a Supabase project and create a cookie for a logged in user.

When trying to access the home route you will be redirected if there is no cookie.

I am unsure of what to do next. Since I don't know how to access the session on the Supabase project. 

## Usage

Clone this repository

Run npm i in the terminal

Create a Supabase project

Be sure to create a .env file

Add in your URL and KEY

Start the server

Create an account (+ verify your email address)

Log in with that account

Then you'll see the cookie appear
